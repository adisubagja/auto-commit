## Make it your own

- Just change `email` and `name` information on file [autocommit.yml, line 29 and 30](https://github.com/mazipan/auto-commit/blob/master/.github/workflows/autocommit.yml#L29)
- Change the scheduling time on file [autocommit.yml, line 10](https://github.com/mazipan/auto-commit/blob/master/.github/workflows/autocommit.yml#L10). You can use [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) if you are not familiar with the cron schedule string.
